This is a mod that is considered malicious in the official VRChat Modding Group.
We do not consider ourselves malicious. 
We want to limit the gaming experience of others as little as possible (this excludes mods like Aimbot, etc).
If there is content you would like protected, feel free to contact us and have your content (worlds and avatars) locked.
We have a very simple whitelist/backlist system that protects content creators (upon request).
As you can see here, the mod is open source and we have nothing to hide.
